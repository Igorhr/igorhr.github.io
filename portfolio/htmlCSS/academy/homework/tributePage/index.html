                  <p>
                    Famous for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones film
                    franchises, Lucas also founded Lucasfilm Ltd. and Industrial
                    Light and Magic. He sold the companies, as well as the
                    rights to the Star Wars franchise, which includes film and
                    television rights, to The Walt Disney Company (DIS) in 2012
                    for $4 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After a tumultuous production process, in 1977 Lucas
                    completed "Star Wars," which revolutionized the American
                    film industry and became the highest-grossing film ever at
                    the time (not adjusting for inflation). The film, which
                    spawned its own universe of toys and other merchandise, made
                    Lucas a fortune, as he owned all of the merchandising
                    rights. He followed up on the movie’s enormous success with
                    "The Empire Strikes Back" in 1980 and "Return of the Jedi"
                    in 1983.

                    With the Star Wars franchise entrenched in popular culture
                    and churning out money at the box office and in toy stores,
                    Lucas paired with Steven Spielberg, to co-create the Indiana
                    Jones film franchise, which included the '80s blockbusters
                    "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Temple of Doom" and "The Last
                    Crusade."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the ‘90s, Star Wars again added to Lucas’ fortune. In
                    1997, he re-released the original Star Wars trilogy in
                    theaters and later on home video, with updated special
                    effects and some unpopular alterations, including one
                    revision to a scene that changed the moral code of a major
                    character. Meanwhile, Lucas was hard at work writing and
                    directing the Star Wars prequels, which consisted of three
                    films released between 1999 and 2005. Despite a lukewarm
                    reception from critics and outrage from many die-hard fans,
                    the three prequels combined to earn billions of dollars at
                    the box office.

                    Han Solo rose from an impoverished childhood on the mean

                    Alliance. As captain of the Millennium Falcon, Han and his
                    co-pilot Chewbacca came to believe in the cause of galactic
                    freedom, joining Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa in
                    the fight against the Empire.

                  Thank you. Thank you all. This is a very, very important award for me. Star Wars, oddly enough, doesn't really get that many awards. I'm not a big favorite with the critics, but who listens to them? I'm not a big industry favorite either, but of course they are a bunch of studio executives. The most important people for any filmmaker, the reason that I make films, is for you! The audience rules! Thank you. Thank you very much!

                <h4><span>About star wars movies</span></h4>
                <p>
                  Well, Star Wars isn't sci-fi at all - it's space opera, which is a sub-genre; I mean, it's sort of halfway between sci-fi and fantasy. The motif I used to tell these stories was the Saturday night-day serial, which is a particular genre which was very popular in the thirties and forties. I wanted it to look just like that and those were - at least, the Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers kinds of things - were space operas. Some people like to call them comic-book stories, but they aren't comic-book under the superhero genre. They're kind of looking at the early part of the century, when adventure serials first started.

                <h4><span>In response to whether film is an art or a business</span></h4>
                <p>
                  The problem is that making film is an art. Selling film is a business. The trouble is that they [studio executives] don't know how to sell films. As a result, they try to make you make films that people will go to without them having to be sold, which is the real key to the problem. And, if they weren't so backwards-- if they can't put a film in a theater and have people rush to the door, they're not interested.
