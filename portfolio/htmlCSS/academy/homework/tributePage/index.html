                    Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble
                    beginnings to become one of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has
                    ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han
                    Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of
                    his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith.

                    Once a heroic Jedi Knight, Darth Vader was seduced by the
                    dark side of the Force, became a Sith Lord, and led the
                    Empire’s eradication of the Jedi Order. He remained in
                    service of the Emperor -- the evil Darth Sidious -- for
                    decades, enforcing his Master’s will and seeking to crush
                    the fledgling Rebel Alliance. But there was still good in
